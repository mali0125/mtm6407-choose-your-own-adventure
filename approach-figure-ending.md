## The End?

As Joe takes a step, his phone starts ringing. He tries to silence his phone as quickly as possible, but it is too late. The man spots Joe and calls out to him. 

**Man:** “Who’s there?”

The man runs towards Joe who is absolutely petrified.

**Joe:** “I’m sorry! I don’t want any trouble!”

**Man:** “Joe? Is that you?”

**Joe:** “Huh? No way! I can’t believe it…”

Joe breathes a sigh of relief. He realizes that the strange man is actually an old friend named Max. They had lost contact seven years ago due to some unfortunate circumstances. In the end, the two friends were reunited through a rather unexpected yet favourable turn of events.
