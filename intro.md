# A Walk in the Forest

It is a warm summer day and Joe is watering the plants in his lawn. He lives in a rural area and there is a dense forest just beyond his own backyard. Since Joe has never explored this forest before, he decides to go for a walk to take in the beautiful scenery. As Joe walks deeper into the forest, he suddenly hears a sound that startles him. When he turns to the direction of the sound, he notices a shadowy figure in the distance. It could be one of his neighbors, but it is hard to tell from this distance. What will Joe do next?
